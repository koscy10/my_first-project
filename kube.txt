Control Plane: The backbone of kubernetes

Pod: is the smallest deployable objet in kubernetes object model

Replica Set: Manages the number of running Pod replicas

Deployment : manages the number of running Pod replicas

Deployment : Manages Pods and replicaSets

Service: Abstracts a set of Pods

Namespace: divides your cluster

Volume : A directory which is assible to Pods Job, Creates one or more Pods & retries execution of the Pods until a specifie
Creates one or more Pods & retries execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminates.


DeamonSet Runs a Pod on all or some Nodes


StatefulSet : used to manage stateful applications


Hands on:

Objectives :


This section will cover kuberntes commands, needed to set up a kubernetes cluster a very basic and neccessary step in the kubernetes journey.

What you will learn --commands needed to:
 -Ready your server 
-Set up the cluster
-Ensure kubenets is running in the cluster
-Join nodes
-Set a kubernets add-on for networking features and policy

-Run a demo microservices app on the cluster you created
